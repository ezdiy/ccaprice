	ecaprice second public release -- version 0.1.1
	Fixed partial bug in weak_ptr and shared_ptr, reference was spelt
	incorrectly for typedefs.  Updated all license headers to reflect
	the MIT license in ccaprice.  Thsi project is now MIT too.  Tons of
	refactoring of implementation structure layout (now reflect ccaprice)
	Wrote a features.txt (reflects ccaprice feature.txt) shocases all
	implemented functionality in ecaprice.  Fixed primitive unit tests
	which need to be rewrote to compile again.  Rewrote makefile to stop
	doing silly things.  Not many changes otherwise to the library, no 
	new features actually implemented.  Most work was focused on getting
	ccaprice stable and useable as a library.  Next months release will
	be more focused on ecaprice.
