				<h2>Contribute to the caprice libraries</h2>
				<p>
					All contributors will be listed in the README file for the
					respective caprice library they contribute to.  You may find
					other contributors in the IRC channel (#kf-engine@irc.freenode.net).
					Questions, patches or concerns can be directed in that channel.
				</p>
				<h2>Bugs</h2>
				<p>
					Bug fixes are always welcome, patches can be attached directly
					on github under the bug tracker.
				</p>
				<h2>Correctness</h2>
				<p>
					Contributors of unit tests which help in verifying the correctness
					of various facilites provided in the caprice libraries are required
					It's a project goal to provide 100% unit test coverage to verify 
					that all functionality is correct in conformance to
					the C and C++ standards.
				</p>
				<h2>Ports</h2>
				<p>
					Developers looking to port the libraries to other architectures are
					in need as well.  Our design goal is to have full support for most
					mobile, desktop, and embedded architrectures.
				</p>
				<h2>Performance, Benchmarking, Analysis</h2>
				<p>
					Benchmarkering and analysis of the performance of various
					facilities in the caprice libraries, is required to ensure
					our facilities are as fast as other libraries, if not faster.
