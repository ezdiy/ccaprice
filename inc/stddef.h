 * Take advantage  of GCC builtins, as  the  latter  method, despite

 * is it derefrences a null pointer, and uses a  cast  that voilates
 * C's aliasing rules.  It can also lead to cofusing compiler errors
 * if an argument is misspelled.  None the less it's a genuis way at
 * implementing the behaviour of offsetof.  There might be a  better
 * way at implementing this functionality  for another compiler. I.E
 * a compiler builtin like GCC.
