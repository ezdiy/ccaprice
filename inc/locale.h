 * Increase this number if more locales are ever required

 * likes language that is viable for any situation.  It's

 * setlocale() depends on two paramaters:
 * 	-catageory
 * 	-locale
 *
 * The category specifes which parts of the
 * internal library change depending on the
 * selected locale.
 * 
 * The category can be any of the following
 * 	-LC_ALL       
 * 	-LC_COLLATE
 * 	-LC_CTYPE
 * 	-LC_MONETARY
 * 	-LC_NUMERIC
 * 	-LC_TIME
 * 
 * LC_ALL:      changes the behaviour of the entire locale
 * LC_COLLATE:  only affects the behaviour of strcoll, and strxfrm
 * LC_CTYPE:    changes the behaviour in <ctype.h>
 * LC_MONETARY  affects the monetary formatting returned by localeconv
 * LC_NUMERIC:  affects _ONLY_ the decimal point on I/O operations and
 *              non-monetary information returned by localeconv()
 * LC_TIME:     only changes the behaviour of strftime.
 * 
 * there is by default a "C" locale which is the minimal basic locale
 * specified by ccaprice. A null string ("") or NULL should select the
 * default enviroment locale.
