The directory structure is quite simple.  If you're looking to modify
add, or just look at something, the layout is as follows.

[INTERNALS]
int/                This is the internals folder for compiler-specific things
                    like SSE/MMX intrinsics (we cannot rely on the ones bundled by
                    the compiler because they include a hosted enviroment)
                    
int/gcc             This is where gcc-specific stuff exists
int/clang           This is where clang-specifics stuff exists

[INCLUDES]
inc/                This is the include folder, pretty much every header is guranteed
                    to be here.  This is where headers should also be put too.

inc/posix/          This is where all posix headers go, they should then be symlinked
                    down a directory into just inc/

[SOURCES]
src/crt/            This is a _special_ directory that implemenets the
                    core runtime support for ccaprice.
                    
src/                This is the source folder for all functionality of the C library
                    each header has it's own subdirectory in here if there are multiple
                    functions in it.  Otherwise single files are created here for those
                    headers.
    
src/string/         All <string.h> functionality is here
src/fenv/           All <fenv.h>   functionality is here
src/stdlib/         All <stdlib.h> functionality is here
src/math/           All <math.h>   functionality is here
src/stdio/          All <stdio.h>  functionality is here
src/setjmp/         All <setjmp.h> functionality is here


src/posix/          This is the source folder for all functionality of the posix
                    library.  Each header not part of C (but part of posix) has
                    has it's own subdirectory in here if there are multiple
                    functions in it.  Otherwise single files are create here for those
                    headers.
              
src/posix/strings/  All <strings.h> functionality is here
                   
                    
I request this directory structure is followed so things are trivial to
find, and so things don't get easily mixed up.  This list should be updated
when new directories are added.
