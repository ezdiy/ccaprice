The directory structure is quite simple.  If you're looking to modify
add, or just look at something, the layout is as follows.

[INTERNALS]
int/                This is the internals folder for compiler-specific things
                    like SSE/MMX intrinsics (we cannot rely on the ones bundled by
                    the compiler because they include a hosted enviroment)
                    
int/gcc             This is where gcc-specific stuff exists
int/clang           This is where clang-specifics stuff exists

[INCLUDES]
inc/                This is the include folder, pretty much every header is guranteed
                    to be here.  This is where headers should also be put too.

[SOURCES]
src/                This is the source directory for all functionality of the C library
                    each header has it's own subdirectory in here if there are multiple
                    functions in it.  Otherwise single files are created here for those
                    headers.
                    
src/math/           This is where all sources for <math.h> exists.  Most architecture
                    specific math functionality will exist in a subdirectory within
                    this directory.  For example all x86_32 stuff exists in x86_32.
                    
src/math/x86_32     All architecture specific math code for x86_32 exists here
src/math/x86_64     All architecture specific math code for x86_64 exists here

src/math/softfpu    This directory contains a portable implementation of all math features
                    for architectures that lack a FPU or where we lack an implementation
                    for the architecture.  As this is implemented naively it's much slower.
                    If the system supports a FPU and we simply lack the code to support it
                    send us a patch!  This should only be used for systems that LACK a FPU!
    
src/string/         All <string.h> functionality is here
src/fenv/           All <fenv.h>   functionality is here
src/stdlib/         All <stdlib.h> functionality is here
src/stdio/          All <stdio.h>  functionality is here
src/setjmp/         All <setjmp.h> functionality is here

[SYSTEM]
sys/                This is where all system specific headers go, and os specific as well.
                    This directory contains folders of the architecture and inside those
                    The operating system (if it's OS specific) and finally the headers.
                
sys/x86_64/         All x86_64 specific headers here
sys/x86_32/         All x86_32 specific headers here
sys/arm/            All arm    specific headers here

[RUNTIME]
crt/                This contains the runtime stuff for _start for the architecture
                    and OS.
                    
crt/x86_32/         All x86_32 specific runtime support here
crt/x86_64/         All x86_64 specific runtime support here
crt/arm/            All arm    specific runtime support here

I request this directory structure is followed so things are trivial to
find, and so things don't get easily mixed up.  This list should be updated
when new directories are added.
